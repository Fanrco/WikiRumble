# WikiRumble

This is my first React-based webapp. It is a hyper-casual trivia game which uses the Wikipedia API and is inspired by the Unity-Based [WikiArena](https://ludokultur.itch.io/wikiarena) by [Fabian Fischer](https://ludokultur.de/).

## About
In this game, you are given two randomly selected wikipedia articles. You must guess either which article is longer or which article has gotten more views in the past 60 days. You have 3 lives to get 10 wins. Each game typically lasts about 5 minutes.

## Future Features

- [x] Add links to the articles upon revealing scores
- [x] Add loading animation for articles
- [ ] Add in/correct animation upon revealing scores
- [ ] Add winning animation (confetti?)
- [ ] Add Past Games Leaderboard
